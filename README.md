# Reddit Bernie Filter

[Reddit Bernie Filter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mjpnnnikhngjjoapjdcdfepkenphaobi) is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to filter out
Bernie Sanders posts on Reddit.

This extension adds a "[Bernie on/off]" link to all reddit pages (in the upper-
right, next to the "preferences" link to allow you to quickly toggle Bernie).

Reddit Bernie Filter generally plays well with the Reddit Enhancement Suite 
(RES).
