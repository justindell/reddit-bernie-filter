# Reddit NSFW Filter

[Reddit NSFW Filter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mjpnnnikhngjjoapjdcdfepkenphaobi) is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to filter out
NSFW posts on reddit.

This extension adds a "[NSFW on/off]" link to all reddit pages (in the upper-
right, next to the "preferences" link to allow you to quickly toggle NSFW).

Reddit NSFW Filter generally plays well with the Reddit Enhancement Suite 
(RES), although it does not filter out NSFW posts displayed by RES's Never
Ending Reddit feature.
